    # Large Pseudo Code steps
    # -------------------------------------
    # 1. Initialize HolidayList Object
    # 2. Load JSON file via HolidayList read_json function
    # 3. Scrape additional holidays using your HolidayList scrapeHolidays function.
    # 3. Create while loop for user to keep adding or working with the Calender
    # 4. Display User Menu (Print the menu)
    # 5. Take user input for their action based on Menu and check the user input for errors
    # 6. Run appropriate method from the HolidayList object depending on what the user input is
    # 7. Ask the User if they would like to Continue, if not, end the while loop, ending the program.  If they do wish to continue, keep the program going. 


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main(); 


# Additional Hints:
# ---------------------------------------------
# You may need additional helper functions both in and out of the classes, add functions as you need to.
#
# No one function should be more then 50 lines of code, if you need more then 50 lines of code
# excluding comments, break the function into multiple functions.
#
# You can store your raw menu text, and other blocks of texts as raw text files 
# and use placeholder values with the format option.
# Example:
# In the file test.txt is "My name is {fname}, I'm {age}"
# Then you later can read the file into a string "filetxt"
# and substitute the placeholders 
# for example: filetxt.format(fname = "John", age = 36)
# This will make your code far more readable, by seperating text from code.
